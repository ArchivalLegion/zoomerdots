Simply my stash of various (.) files for *nix system enviroments. If there are syntax or other errors, please open a issue.
  
  I'm attempting for a dotfile(s) for every ICCCM/EWMH compliant and small window managers such as: JWM, IceWM, Openbox, etc...
  
  I'd like to create a fonts.conf that's extensive with font replacement/subsitutions and forced filtering etc.. for easy refrence/use.
